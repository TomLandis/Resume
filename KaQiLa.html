  <p><span class="emph">Rib Movement Exercise<br> – KaQiLa –</span>
    <br>KaQiLa is a revolutionary rib exercise method comprising a series of movements that feature in over 500 different kata (forms). With a focus on the roles and potential of the ribs, which are highly involved in smooth bodily movements and various <span class="redo popup" id="myBtn" onclick="slidein()">physical  symptoms</span> as they move together with the vertebral column (spine), this hugely popular Japanese health exercise program allows anyone to easily and effectively move their ribs and the large and small joints around them. KaQiLa’s unique kata allow anyone to enjoy exercising easily and stylishly, and all it takes is just one session to gain a feeling of functional improvement.</p>
